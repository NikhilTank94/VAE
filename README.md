# Variational-Autoencoder---VAE

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is an autoencoder that regularizes and breaks-down (encode) the input to its latent space such that during the decoding phase some new data can be generated from it while keeping the good properties (principal component) of the input. The approach work by taking the input parameter and setting encoder and decoder as a neural network and learns the best encoding-decoding scheme over iteration and optimization steps. Thus, eventually, the encoder and decoder create a bottleneck for the data and feature in the middle that ensures only the principal component or the key features of the input to get through and feeding it to be reconstructed. This is in contrast with the GAN, as GAN generates the novel candidate in the middle of the process and the True/False as an output of the model. The model generates handwritten number digits on it own using the learning made from MNIST database.
